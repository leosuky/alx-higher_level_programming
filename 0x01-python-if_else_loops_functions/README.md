Task 0 - This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.\n
Task 1 - The variable number will store a different value every time you will run this program\n
Task 2 - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.\n
Task 3 - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line again\n
Task 4 - Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)\n
Task 5 - Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.\n
Task 6 - Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.\n
Task 7 - Write a function that checks for lowercase character. \n
Task 8 - Write a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.\n
Task 9 - Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.\n
Task 10 - Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.\n
Task 11 - Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.\n
Task 12 - Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. \n
Task 13 - Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.\n
Task 14 - Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) , not followed by a new line.\n
Task 15 - Write a function that creates a copy of the string, removing the character at the position n (not the Python way, the C array index).\n
Task 16 - Write the Python function def magic_calculation(a, b, c): that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode\n
